      <h2>Object 2 — Steel sewing needle (c. 1800–1850)</h2>

      <h3>What am I looking at?</h3>
      <p>A small steel needle with a sharp point and a tiny eye for thread. It fits easily between finger and thumb and would have been used thousands of times.</p>

      <h3>What is it made from?</h3>
      <p>Hardened steel, polished so it could pass smoothly through leather.</p>

      <h3>How was it used?</h3>
      <p>Threaded and pulled through leather again and again to sew gloves by hand. The work was repetitive and precise.</p>

      <h3>Who used it?</h3>
      <p>Most often women working at home, fitting paid sewing around daily responsibilities.</p>

      <h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
      <p>It represents invisible labour — the process between raw material and finished object.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>30-second version</summary>
        <p>This needle was used repeatedly to stitch leather gloves by hand. It represents skilled, patient work done quietly at home.</p>

    <section id="woodstock" class="card">
      <h2>Why was Woodstock known for glove-making?</h2>
      <p>Because it had the right conditions rather than a single factory: access to fine leather, skilled home-based labour, and nearby markets. Glove-making was quiet, precise work that could be done at home in good light, and the town became known for reliable, well-made gloves.</p>

    <section id="redditch" class="card">
      <h2>Where were needles made?</h2>
      <p>Many sewing needles used in Britain were made in specialist needle-making towns elsewhere, then sold through merchants to places like Woodstock. The needle connects domestic work with wider industrial networks.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="time" class="card">
      <h2>How long did it take to make a pair of gloves?</h2>
      <p>Many hours, often spread over more than one day. Cutting the leather required care, and sewing each finger was slow, precise work. Rushing could ruin the leather and waste hours of effort.</p>

    <section id="who-paid" class="card">
      <h2>Who paid for the gloves?</h2>
      <p>Gloves were bought by a wide range of ordinary people. They were part of everyday dress for walking, visiting, church, and travel, valued for usefulness, fit, and durability rather than spectacle.</p>

    <section id="what-happened" class="card">
      <h2>What happened to this kind of work?</h2>
      <p>As factories and machines expanded, production moved away from homes into workshops and larger centres. The skills did not vanish, but the organisation of the work changed — and local hand-sewing became less common.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="sensory" class="card">
      <h2>What would these gloves feel like to wear?</h2>
      <p>Soft and close-fitting. The leather would feel cool at first, warming quickly. You might faintly feel the seams along the sides of your fingers. With time, the gloves would become more flexible and take on the shape of the wearer’s hands.</p>

    <section id="bridge" class="card">
      <h2>What does this have to do with us now?</h2>
      <p>It reminds us that everyday objects were once made slowly, by people whose work was woven into daily life. It invites a pause to notice the hands behind the objects we rely on — and to consider what we value: speed, or care.</p>
