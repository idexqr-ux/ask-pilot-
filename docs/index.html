        <h3>What am I looking at?</h3>
        <p>You are looking at a pair of leather gloves shaped to fit human hands. The leather is thin and supple, and the seams along the fingers are stitched by hand. They narrow gently at the wrist and were made to be worn close to the skin.</p>

        <h3>What are they made from?</h3>
        <p>Fine leather, often lamb or kid skin, chosen because it could be cut thin without tearing and would stretch slightly with wear.</p>

        <h3>How were they made?</h3>
        <p>The leather was cut by hand and stitched finger by finger with fine thread. The work required good light, steady hands, and patience.</p>

        <h3>Who would have worn them?</h3>
        <p>Ordinary people for walking, visiting, church, and travel. These were practical gloves, valued for fit and durability.</p>

        <h3>Why do they matter?</h3>
        <p>They show the quiet skill behind everyday life — not only the hands that wore them, but the hands that made them.</p>

          <p>These gloves were made by hand from fine leather. Each finger was stitched carefully. They were worn daily and valued for fit and durability.</p>

        <h3>What am I looking at?</h3>
        <p>A small steel needle with a sharp point and a tiny eye for thread. It fits easily between finger and thumb and would have been used thousands of times.</p>

        <h3>What is it made from?</h3>
        <p>Hardened steel, polished so it could pass smoothly through leather.</p>

        <h3>How was it used?</h3>
        <p>Threaded and pulled through leather again and again to sew gloves by hand. The work was repetitive and precise.</p>

        <h3>Who used it?</h3>
        <p>Most often women working at home, fitting paid sewing around daily responsibilities.</p>

        <h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
        <p>It represents invisible labour — the process between raw material and finished object.</p>

          <summary>30-second version</summary>
          <p>This needle was used repeatedly to stitch leather gloves by hand. It represents skilled, patient work done quietly at home.</p>

        <p>Because it had the right conditions rather than a single factory: access to fine leather, skilled home-based labour, and nearby markets. Glove-making was quiet, precise work that could be done at home in good light, and the town became known for reliable, well-made gloves.</p>

        <p>Many sewing needles used in Britain were made in specialist needle-making towns elsewhere, then sold through merchants to places like Woodstock. The needle connects domestic work with wider industrial networks.</p>

        <p>Many hours, often spread over more than one day. Cutting the leather required care, and sewing each finger was slow, precise work. Rushing could ruin the leather and waste hours of effort.</p>

        <p>As factories and machines expanded, production moved away from homes into workshops and larger centres. The skills did not vanish, but the organisation of the work changed — and local hand-sewing became less common.</p>

        <p>Soft and close-fitting. The leather would feel cool at first, warming quickly. You might faintly feel the seams along the sides of your fingers. With time, the gloves would become more flexible and take on the shape of the wearer’s hands.</p>

        <p>It reminds us that everyday objects were once made slowly, by people whose work was woven into daily life. It invites a pause to notice the hands behind the objects we rely on — and to consider what we value: speed, or care.</p>
